Aeolus Ruler of the Winds

01:
L: Land in the sky?

01 A:
OS: Aye, as we drew nearer it became clearer. They were islands floating in the sky.

02:
L: Was there anything on the islands?

02 A:
OS: They were the home of Aeolus, the ruler of the winds.

03:
L: How did you get on to the islands if they were in the sky?

03 A:
OS: With great difficulty! We used ropes to climb up to the island closest to the sea, and then we created a series of bridges and ladders between the islands.

04:
L: What was at the top?

04 A:
OS: A beautiful tree with golden leaves, the wind seemed to dance around it.

04 B:
OS: A magnificent palace made of crystal, it glistened in the sun like the ocean at sunset.

05 1:
L: Where was Aeolus?

05 2:
L: Was Aeolus inside?

05 1A:
OS: He sat at the base of the tree with his mind deep in thought. Once he noticed we were there he looked pleased.

05 2A:
OS: Aye, he sat on a throne that reached into the heavens, he seemed annoyed by our presence.

06:
L: What happened next?

06 A:
OS: He stood up, introduced himself, then greeted each man individually.

06 B:
OS: Aeolus demanded we introduce ourselves and explain our intrusion into his domain.

07 1:
L: That doesn't sound right, you said he seemed annoyed that you were there?

07 2: 
L: What did he do next?

07 3:
L: Wait, I thought you said he was pleased when he saw you?

07 1A:
OS: Oh yes of course, my mistake... he demanded we introduce ourselves and explain our intrusion into his domain.

07 2A:
OS: He wished to speak to our leader, Odysseus stepped forward, and then they left together.

07 3A:
OS: Oh yes, what I meant to say was...
He stood up, introduced himself, then greeted each man individually.

08:
L: Where did they go?

08 A:
OS: I don't know, one minute they were there and the next they were not.

09:
L: Did Odysseus return?

09 A:
OS: Of course, they both did. Odyssesus was clutching a leather bag tightly. Aeolus gave us a westerly wind, and used his power to lift us all back to the ships.

09 AA:
OS: He said that if we would be home in Ithaca within ten days.

10:
L: Were you?

10 A:
OS: Not exactly...
