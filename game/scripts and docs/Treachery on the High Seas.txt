Treachery on the High Seas

01:
L: What happened?

01 A:
OS: Everything went well for the first few days, the winds were good and the sails strong, but soon some of the men started to voice their doubts.

02:
L: Doubts? What did the men have doubts about?

02 A:
OS: Odysseus. Some of the men thought that the bag he received from Aeolus contained treasures that he was keeping for himself. 

03:
L: Did you agree?

03 A:
OS: No, Odysseus wouldn't keep something from us unless he had to.

03 B:
OS: Aye, regretfully greed got the better of me. The way he always held the bag so tightly made me believe it must contain something truly precious.

04 1:
L: Did they open the bag?

04 2:
L: Did you open the bag?

04 1A:
OS: Not at first, there was a lot of talk amongst the men as to when it should be done, it was undecided until Ithaca came into view.

05:
L: What happened once Ithaca was in sight?

05 A:
OS: The men who wanted to open the bag became mad with greed, they tor the bag from Odysseus.

05 B:
OS: We thought this was our last chance, that once we reached Ithaca Odysseus would have all the riches for himself. so we took the bag.

06 1:
L: I thought  you wanted to open the bag too?

06 2:
L: What was inside the bag?

06 3:
L: I thought you didn't want to open the bag?

06 2A:
OS: Inside the bag were all the winds except the western wind. Aeolus had given them to Odysseus so they wouldn't be bale to blow us off course.

07:
L: What happened once the bag had been opened?

07 A:
OS: We were blown all the way back to floating islands of Aeolus. Our journey would have ended had it not been for greed.

08:
L: What happened next?

08 A:
OS: Odysseus went back to Aeolus for help, and despite Odysseus' pleas Aeolus wouldn't help us. He said the gods had cursed Odysseus and there was nothing he could do.

08 AA:
OS: We were then pushed away from Aeolus' islands by a strong wind which soon died. We were forced to row our way to the next land we saw to gather supplies.
