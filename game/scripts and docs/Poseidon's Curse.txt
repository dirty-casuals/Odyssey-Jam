Poseidon's Curse

01:
L: What happened after you left the land of the cyclopes?

01 A:
OS: We were caught in a great storm, it blew us off course, further out to sea. We became lost.

02:
L: Lost? Surely you had navigators? Couldn't they use the stars to guide you?

02 A:
OS: I'm sure they could have had we seen any stars. The storm lasted days. We were at the mercy of the sea.

03:
L: Did the storms ease?

03 A:
OS: Aye, after a few days the tides died down and the wind stopped... we were dead in the water.

03 B: 
OS: Too much so! We were stuck in the doldrums.

04 1:
L: What did you do?

04 2:
L: The doldrums?

04 1A:
OS: Odysseus called a meeting of all the ships captains to discuss how we would escape.

04 2A:
OS: It's a nautical term, it means there was no wind to blow the sails, not tide to push the ship. We were floating island of wood.

05:
L: Did you go?

05 A:
OS: Me? No, I wasn't a captain. I stayed on the ship and waited to hear what was going on.

05 B:
OS: Aye, I rowed the boat for Odysseus to take him to the meeting in the most central ship. 

06 1:
L: So what happened in the meeting?

06 2:
L: What happened in the meeting?

06 1A:
OS: I don't know exactly, because I wasn't there. 

06 2A:
OS: The ship captains discussed with Odysseus our options on how to escape our situation.

07 1:
L: What was decided?

07 2:
L: What were the options?

07 1A:
OS: Odysseus came back to the ship, he said we would row the ships until we found a wind. Then men weren't pleased but understood that it was the only way home.

07 2A:
OS: One captain suggested we wait, surely the clouds would clear and we could navigate again, at least enough for us to see the sun.

07 2B:
OS: One captain suggested we row the ships until we found a wind or tide once more. He said we were wasting provisions by not doing anything.

08:
L: Did you agree?

08 A:
OS: Wasn't my place to agree or disagree, I was there to row Odysessus' boat, nothing more.

09:
L: What did Odysseus think?

09 A:
OS: He agreed that we should wait, a wind would come eventually, and we still had the cyclops' sheep, so food wasn't a problem.

09 B:
OS: He agreed that we were wasting resources by staying, we should row the ships until we find a tide.

10 1:
L: That's not the plan you said?

10 2:
L: So it was settled then?

10 3:
L: That is a different plan?

10 1A:
OS: Oh sorry, I missed have missed that piece of the story.

10 2A:
OS: Aye, each captain went back to the ship to inform their men. I rowed Odysseus back to our ship, so he could do the same.

11:
L: What happened? Did the plan work?

11 A:
OS: Three days later the wind picked up, and we saw a shimmer in the distance. At that distance we had no idea what it was, as we drew nearer it seemed to be land, but in the sky...
